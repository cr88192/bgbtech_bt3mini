Scripts may use a BASIC variant.
* Names will be case sensitive.
* Keywords may be either upper or lower case.
* Typical variables will be in a global scope.
** Though, the global names may also access console cvars.
** For GOSUB, dynamic scoping will also exist.
* Variables will be dynamically typed.

Numbers:
* Numbers will be integer or floating point.
** Integer numbers will have a range of 2^62.
** Floating point numbers will have roughly Binary64 precision.
* Will use C style 0x notation for hexadecimal.

Strings:
* Will be quoted using double quotes;
* Will use C style character escape notation.

Keyword Commands:
* DIM name(size)
** Create an array.
* END
** Stop script
* FOR var = initval to endval [STEP stepval]
** Begin a FOR loop.
** Loop finishes with a "NEXT var"
** Loop is initialized to initval, and continues until endval.
** If STEP is provided, it gives a step to apply for each loop.
** Step defaults to 1.
* GOSUB label [argslist]
** Call to a label as a subroutine.
** Returns via RETURN
** ArgsList will be a comma-separated list of name=value pairs.
*** These will be assigned as temporaries within the callee's scope.
* GOTO label
** Transfer control to a label.
* IF cond GOTO label
** If cond evaluates to non-zero, goto label
* IF cond THEN statement
** If cond evaluates to non-zero, perform statement
* LET name=expr
** Assign to a variable, creating if it does not exist.
* NEXT var
** Advance to the next cycle in a preceding FOR loop.
* PRINT printexprlist
* REM stuff
** REM ignores any following tokens.
* RETURN
** Return from subroutine.
* RETURN expr
** Return from subroutine with return-value expression.
* STOP
** Stop script
* TEMP name=expr
** Create a temporary variable.
** This variable will have a dynamic scope and only exists between a GOSUB/RETURN.
* TEMP commalist
** Create multiple temporary variables.

Other Commands:
* name:
** label
* name=expr
** Assign to an existing variable.
* concmd printexprlist
** Print arguments and then pass resulting line to the console.
* name = GOSUB label [argslist]
** Like GOSUB but with a return value.
** On "RETURN expr", the value of expr will be assigned to the variable.

PrintExprList:
* List of expressions for a PRINT and similar.
* May use comma or semicolon as separators.
* Comma, may whitespace pad between items.
* Semicolon, no extra whitespace pad is added.
* If list ends in semicolon, no newline is added.
** Otherwise, a newline is added by default.


Operator Precedence:
* Unary: +, -, !, ~
** Right associative.
* Binary: *, /, %
* Binary: +, -
* Binary: &, |, ^
* Binary: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
